[00:23.10] Touch my body tender
[00:27.52] 'Cause the feeling makes me weak
[00:33.43] Kicking off the covers
[00:37.94] I see the ceiling while you're looking down at me
[01:02.44] 
[00:44.04] How can we go back to being friends
[00:48.91] When we just shared a bed?
[00:54.26] How can you look at me and pretend
[00:59.18] I'm someone you've never met?
[01:13.68] 
[01:04.57] It was last December
[01:08.90] You were layin' on my chest
[01:14.87] I still remember
[01:19.15] I was scared to take a breath, didn't want you to move your head
[01:51.15] 
[01:25.48] How can we go back to being friends
[01:30.34] When we just shared a bed? (Yeah)
[01:35.82] How can you look at me and pretend
[01:40.42] I'm someone you've never met?
[01:54.92] 
[01:45.88] The devil in your eyes
[01:52.67] Won't deny the lies you've sold
[01:58.74] I'm holding on too tight
[02:02.67] While you let go, this is casual
[02:18.67] 
[02:17.05] How can we go back to being friends
[02:22.14] When we just shared a bed? (Yeah)
[02:27.40] How can you look at me and pretend
[02:32.16] I'm someone you've never met?
[02:46.66] 
[02:37.71] How can we go back to being friends
[02:42.57] When we just shared a bed? (Yeah)
[02:48.03] How can you look at me and pretend
[02:52.88] I'm someone you've never met?
[03:07.38] 
[03:00.21] I'm someone you've never met (yeah)
